  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex Grey was born in Columbus, Ohio on November 29, 1953 (Sagittarius), the middle child of a gentle
  middle-class couple. His father was a graphic designer and encouraged his sonâ€™s drawing ability. Young Alex would
  collect insects and dead animals from the suburban neighborhood and bury them in the back yard. The themes of death and
  transcendence weave throughout his artworks, from the earliest drawings to later performances, paintings and sculpture.
  Alex went to the Columbus College of Art and Design on full scholarship from 1971-3. Grey dropped out of art school and
  painted billboards for Columbus Outdoor Advertising, 1973-4. Grey then moved to Boston to study with and work as studio 
  assistant for conceptual artist, Jay Jaroslav, at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1974-5.
